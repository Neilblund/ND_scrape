"343","https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-racism-blind/","Certainly there is some warrant for this equation of colorblindness with non-racism; in many everyday encounters with white people-in the grocery checkout lane, for instance, or when driving a car—people of color would indeed prefer not to be treated differently because of their skin color. But colorblindness is not always non-racist. In a multicultural and racist society, whites’ refusal to acknowledge color will sometimes mean refusing to recognize the obstacles facing people of color or to see that, depending on the context, different ethnic and racial groups may have distinct needs and interests.

"412","https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-white/","In many Critical Social Justice sources (e.g., Sensoy and DiAngelo, p. 101), racism is Theorized to be that which white people do with regard to racial relations, so being racist is also a property of being white (see also, complicity and white complicity). This is because a white racial identity is by definition positioned on the dominant end of racial power dynamics. (To wit: “Although commonsense understandings about social power often have us thinking in terms of numbers, as we have argued, power is not dependent on numbers but on position. In other words, power is dependent on what position a group holds and their ability to affect other groups from that position.” Source: Sensoy and DiAngelo, p. 120.)"
